# ERIG KiCad library 

Use like all other libs. 

## Adding stuff 

Make sure to put stuff where it belongs! Sort somewhat usefully - don't put transformers into a diode library etc. 

## my 3d models are missing

3D modles are a little messy. Im usure how to fix this as of writing. What works: cloning this project as a submodule into the root of your project.
